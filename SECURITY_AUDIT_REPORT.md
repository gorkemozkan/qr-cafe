# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the QR Cafe project, examining the entire codebase for security vulnerabilities, leaks, and memory leaks. The project demonstrates **excellent security practices** with proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and security headers. Only one minor issue and several recommendations for improvements were identified.

## Overall Security Status: ✅ EXCELLENT

The project follows security best practices with only **1 Minor Issue** and **8 Recommendations** for improvement.

---

## 🔴 Issues Found

### 1. Potential Information Disclosure (Minor)
**Location:** `app/api/storage/upload/route.ts:83`
**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Error messages might leak internal details

**Issue:** Error message exposes internal error details in upload endpoint:
```typescript
error: `Upload failed: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"}`
```

**Recommendation:** Return generic error message in production while logging detailed errors server-side.

## ✅ Security Strengths

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Proper Supabase authentication implementation
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies correctly implemented
- ✅ User ownership checks on all sensitive operations
- ✅ JWT token handling via Supabase
- ✅ Proper session management

### Input Validation & XSS Protection
- ✅ Comprehensive Zod schema validation on all inputs
- ✅ No dangerous HTML injection patterns found (innerHTML, eval, etc.)
- ✅ CAPTCHA integration for authentication forms
- ✅ Strong password requirements enforced

### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented across all sensitive endpoints
- ✅ CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- ✅ Proper error handling without sensitive data leakage (mostly)
- ✅ Authentication required for all admin endpoints

### File Upload Security
- ✅ File type validation with MIME type verification
- ✅ File size restrictions (5MB limit)
- ✅ File name sanitization
- ✅ User ownership verification
- ✅ Proper file path isolation (`user_id/filename`)

### Security Headers & CSP
- ✅ Comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection enabled
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security in production
- ✅ Proper referrer policy

### SQL Injection Protection
- ✅ Using Supabase client (parameterized queries)
- ✅ No raw SQL query construction found
- ✅ All database interactions through safe ORM methods

### Memory Leak Prevention
- ✅ Proper cleanup in React useEffect hooks
- ✅ URL.revokeObjectURL() called for blob URLs
- ✅ Event listeners properly removed
- ✅ No memory leak patterns identified

### Secret Management
- ✅ All secrets properly externalized to environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys or passwords found
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration implemented

---

## 💡 Recommendations for Enhancement

### 1. Environment-Based Error Handling
**Priority:** Medium
**Current State:** Error messages sometimes expose internal details
**Recommendation:** Implement environment-based error responses:

```typescript
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

// In catch blocks:
return NextResponse.json({
  error: isDevelopment ? error.message : "Operation failed"
}, { status: 500 });
```

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
**Priority:** Medium  
**Current State:** Basic in-memory rate limiting
**Recommendations:**
- Consider Redis-based rate limiting for production scalability
- Implement progressive delays for repeated violations
- Add rate limiting monitoring/alerting

### 3. Password Policy Strengthening  
**Priority:** Low
**Current State:** Minimum 6 characters with basic complexity
**Supabase Config:** `supabase/config.toml:139-142`
**Recommendation:** 
- Increase minimum password length to 8+ characters
- Enable stronger password requirements: `lower_upper_letters_digits_symbols`

### 4. Add Security Headers Middleware
**Priority:** Low
**Recommendation:** Consider adding Helmet.js or similar for additional security headers

### 5. Implement Request Logging
**Priority:** Medium
**Recommendation:** Add structured logging for security events:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations  
- File upload attempts
- Administrative actions

### 6. Add Input Sanitization
**Priority:** Low
**Recommendation:** While XSS protection is good, consider adding DOMPurify for any user-generated content display

### 7. Implement API Response Encryption
**Priority:** Low
**Recommendation:** Consider encrypting sensitive data in API responses for additional protection

### 8. Security Monitoring
**Priority:** Medium
**Recommendation:** Implement security monitoring for:
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- Large file upload attempts
